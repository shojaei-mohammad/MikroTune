MikroTune: Automated Frequency and Bandwidth Tester for MikroTik Devices

Description:
    MikroTune is a Python-based tool designed to assist network administrators
    and engineers in testing different frequencies on MikroTik devices. The
    program iterates through specified frequency ranges, checks the connectivity
    and signal quality, and then performs a bandwidth test under optimal conditions.

Features:
    1. User-friendly CLI for entering device and test parameters.
    2. Support for custom frequency ranges with default values.
    3. Configurable bandwidth test parameters like protocol, direction, limit, and duration.
    4. Utilizes external JSON configuration for values such as signal and ping thresholds.
    5. Automated frequency changes with checks for station registration.
    6. Signal strength and ping response time validations before bandwidth tests.
    7. Comprehensive logging of test results for analysis.

Usage:
    Simply run the script and follow the CLI prompts to input necessary parameters.
    Results will be logged in a specified output file.

Disclaimer:
    Always use MikroTune in a controlled environment before deploying in a production setting.
    Improper use or incorrect configurations may disrupt network services. Ensure compliance
    with local regulations when adjusting frequencies.
